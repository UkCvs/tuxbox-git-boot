Changes since U-Boot 0.2.2:
======================================================================

* Patch by Stefan Roese, 20 Mar 2003:
  - CPCI4052 update (support for revision 3).
  - Set edge conditioning circuitry on PPC405GPr for compatibility
    to existing PPC405GP designs.
  - Clip udiv to 5 bits on PPC405 (serial.c).

* Avoid flicker on the TRAB's VFD by synchronizing the enable with
  the HSYNC/VSYNC. Requires new CPLD code (Version 101 for Rev. 100
  boards, version 153 for Rev. 200 boards).

* Patch by Vladimir Gurevich, 12 Mar 2003:
  Fix relocation problem of statically initialized string pointers
  in common/cmd_pci.c

* Patch by Kai-Uwe Blöm, 12 Mar 2003:
  Cleanup & bug fixes for JFFS2 code:
  - the memory mangement was broken. It caused havoc on malloc by
    writing beyond the block boundaries.
  - the length calculation for files was wrong, sometimes resulting
    in short file reads.
  - data copying now optionally takes fragment version numbers into
    account, to avoid copying from older data.
  See doc/README.JFFS2 for details.

  which showed "Receiver is not ready" errors when U-Boot was
  processing the receive buffers slower than the network controller
  was filling them.

* Patch by Andreas Oberritter, 09 Nov 2002:
  Change behaviour of NetLoop(): return -1 for errors, filesize
  otherwise; return code 0 is valid an means no file loaded - in this
